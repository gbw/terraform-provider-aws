In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import MediaConnect Flow using the `arn`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = aws_mediaconnect_flow.example
  id = "arn:aws:mediaconnect:us-west-2:123456789012:flow:1-7e7a28d2-163f-4b8f:tfflow"
